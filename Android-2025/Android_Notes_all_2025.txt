HOW Android boots  + complete boot process + more technical 

The Android boot process is a sequence of steps that initializes the system and prepares it for use. Here's a detailed technical overview of the complete boot process:

### 1. **Power On**
- **Boot ROM**: When the device is powered on, the Boot ROM code is executed. This code is hardwired into the processor and is responsible for initializing the hardware and loading the bootloader from a predefined location (usually from the internal storage).

### 2. **Bootloader**
- **Primary Bootloader**: The primary bootloader (such as U-Boot or Little Kernel) is loaded into memory. It initializes the basic hardware components and loads the secondary bootloader.
- **Secondary Bootloader**: The secondary bootloader (such as Android's Bootloader) performs additional hardware initialization, sets up memory, and loads the kernel.

### 3. **Kernel Initialization**
- **Kernel**: The Linux kernel is loaded into memory. The kernel is responsible for initializing the core system components, including the CPU, memory, and device drivers.
- **Initramfs**: The initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) is loaded. This temporary filesystem contains essential drivers and scripts needed to mount the real root filesystem.

### 4. **Init Process**
- **Init**: The `init` process is the first user-space process started by the kernel. It is responsible for setting up the system environment and starting essential services.
  - **init.rc**: The `init.rc` script is executed, which contains instructions for initializing system properties, mounting filesystems, and starting system services.

### 5. **Zygote**
- **Zygote**: The Zygote process is started by `init`. Zygote is a special process that initializes the Dalvik/ART runtime and preloads common classes and resources. It serves as a template for creating new application processes.
  - **Forking**: When a new application is launched, Zygote forks itself to create a new process, which reduces the startup time for applications.

### 6. **System Server**
- **System Server**: The System Server process is started by Zygote. It is responsible for starting and managing core Android services such as Activity Manager, Window Manager, Package Manager, and more.

### 7. **Boot Completed**
- **Boot Completed**: Once all essential services are started, the system broadcasts the `BOOT_COMPLETED` intent. Applications and services that need to perform initialization tasks upon boot can listen for this broadcast.

### Detailed Steps with Kernel Versions

#### Kernel Initialization
- **Kernel Version**: The specific kernel version used by the Android version.
  - **Kernel Modules**: Load necessary kernel modules for hardware support.
  - **Device Drivers**: Initialize device drivers for hardware components.

#### Init Process
- **init.rc**: Configuration file for the `init` process.
  - **Mount Filesystems**: Mount system, data, and other necessary filesystems.
  - **Set System Properties**: Configure system properties and environment variables.
  - **Start Services**: Start essential system services and daemons.

#### Zygote and System Server
- **Zygote**: Preloads common classes and resources.
  - **Forking**: Creates new application processes.
- **System Server**: Manages core Android services.
  - **Activity Manager**: Manages activities and tasks.
  - **Window Manager**: Manages windows and UI components.
  - **Package Manager**: Manages installed applications.

### Summary of Kernel Versions and Changes

- **Android 1.5 Cupcake**: Kernel 2.6.27
- **Android 1.6 Donut**: Kernel 2.6.29

### 1. **Power On**
- **Boot ROM**: When the device is powered on, the Boot ROM code is executed. This code is hardwired into the processor and is responsible for initializing the hardware and loading the bootloader from a predefined location (usually from the internal storage).

### Detailed Steps Done by Boot ROM

1. **Power-On Reset (POR)**
   - **Initialization**: When the device is powered on, the processor undergoes a power-on reset (POR). This reset ensures that the processor starts in a known state.
   - **Clock Initialization**: The system clock is initialized to provide timing signals for the processor and other components.

2. **Processor Initialization**
   - **Register Reset**: All processor registers are reset to their default values.
   - **Memory Initialization**: The Boot ROM code initializes the memory controller to set up access to RAM and other memory regions.

3. **Hardware Checks**
   - **Self-Test**: The Boot ROM performs a basic self-test to check the integrity of the processor and essential hardware components.
   - **Peripheral Initialization**: Basic initialization of essential peripherals such as UART (for debugging), GPIO, and timers.

4. **Boot Mode Selection**
   - **Boot Mode Pins**: The Boot ROM reads the boot mode pins to determine the boot source (e.g., internal storage, external storage, network).
   - **Boot Source Identification**: Based on the boot mode pins, the Boot ROM identifies the source from which to load the bootloader (e.g., eMMC, NAND, SD card).

5. **Bootloader Loading**
   - **Storage Access**: The Boot ROM code accesses the predefined storage location (e.g., eMMC, NAND) to locate the bootloader.
   - **Bootloader Verification**: The Boot ROM verifies the integrity of the bootloader (e.g., checksum or signature verification) to ensure it is not corrupted.
   - **Bootloader Loading**: The verified bootloader is loaded into RAM.

6. **Execution Transfer**
   - **Jump to Bootloader**: The Boot ROM transfers execution to the bootloader by jumping to its entry point in RAM.
   - **Boot ROM Handoff**: The Boot ROM hands off control to the bootloader, which then takes over the initialization process.

### Summary
The Boot ROM is a critical component in the Android boot process. It performs essential hardware initialization, selects the boot source, loads the bootloader, and transfers control to the bootloader. This ensures that the device starts in a known state and is ready to proceed with the rest of the boot process.
