Here are 100 embedded interview questions for experienced candidates. These questions cover a range of topics related to embedded systems, including programming, hardware, and real-time operating systems. Keep in mind that interviewers may ask variations of these questions, so it's important to understand the underlying concepts.

What is an embedded system?
An embedded system is a computer system designed to perform specific tasks with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system. These systems are typically low-power, small, and operate in real-time. Examples of embedded systems include smart appliances, medical devices, automotive systems, and industrial control systems.

What are the key characteristics of embedded systems?
The key characteristics of embedded systems are their real-time operation, low-power consumption, small size, and dedicated function. They are typically designed to perform a specific task, often in a harsh or challenging environment. They may also have limited resources, such as memory, processing power, or energy supply, and must be reliable and operate continuously for extended periods.

Explain microcontroller vs. microprocessor.
A microcontroller is a small computer on a single chip that contains a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals. It is typically used for embedded systems where low-power, real-time operation is required. In contrast, a microprocessor is a more powerful CPU that does not include built-in peripherals and is used in general-purpose computing applications, such as personal computers and servers.

What is an RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)?
An RTOS is a type of operating system designed for embedded systems that require real-time processing. It manages the allocation of resources, such as processing time, memory, and input/output, to ensure that tasks are executed within specific time constraints. Examples of RTOSs include FreeRTOS, VxWorks, and QNX.

Describe the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.
Preemptive scheduling is a method of scheduling tasks in an operating system where higher priority tasks can interrupt lower priority tasks. This ensures that important tasks are executed immediately, even if lower priority tasks are still running. Non-preemptive scheduling, on the other hand, allows a task to continue running until it completes or explicitly yields control to another task.

How do you measure the performance of an embedded system?
The performance of an embedded system can be measured using various metrics, 
including processing time, memory usage, power consumption, and throughput.
 Benchmark tests can be used to evaluate the system's performance under different loads and conditions, 
and profiling tools can be used to analyze the system's behavior and identify bottlenecks or performance issues.
 Real-time performance can also be measured using techniques such as response time analysis and worst-case execution time analysis.
